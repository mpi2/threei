                    The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute currently generates 160 knockout mouse lines a year, all of which are phenotyped by the 3i
                    consortium. One third of the genes are chosen for their likely involvement in human diseases (e.g. as shown in GWAS studies),
                    one third are chosen from suggestions of participating scientists and one third are randomly selected from the International
                    Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) embryonic stem cell pool (see below). Approximately 25% of the knockout lines generated are
                    embryonically lethal and are phenotyped as heterozygotes. Whilst lines homozygous for the targeted alleles present with a higher hit rate,
                    lines assessed in the heterozygous state were still remarkably informative. A characterization of the first 250 knockout mouse lines that completed
                    the Sanger phenotyping pipeline pre-3i has been published by

                <p>Most of the knockouts lines are generated by a knock-in first approach (Skarnes et al, Nature 2011). This technique combines the advantages of a reporter-tagged allele with a conditional knockout approach (see figure 1).</p>

                <p>Historically, approximately 25% of knockout lines at Sanger have been phenotyped as tm1b alleles and 75% as tm1a alleles. An internal study showed that 60% of the tm1a lines were complete knockouts, 16% were hypomorphs and 24% had residual gene activity. By the end of 2014, all lines will be analysed in their tm1b form. The knock-in first approach relies on the identication of a critical exon common to all trascript variants that, when deleted, creates a frame-shift mutation. The critical exon is defined by a computer-assisted procedure and flanked by loxP sites. Upstream, an FRT-flanked lacZ-loxP-neomycin cassette is inserted. The lacZ-loxP-neomycin cassette contains a splice acceptor and also codes for a poly-A tail. In its full-length form (tm1a), the construct therefore generates a null allele by creating a shortened transcript that lacks the critical exon. A lacZ reporter knockout (tm1b) can be generated by exposing mice or cells to Cre recombinase. Alternatively, exposure to Flp recombinase will create a wild type allele (tm1c) which can then be used to create conditional knockout strains by crossing the mice to a tissue-specific Cre-expressing strain. Genes expressed in ES cells are usually targeted with a promoterless construct, genes not expressed with a promoter-driven construct. Promoter-driven constructs carry a slightly higher risk for off-target effects. If the target gene is small and does not contain a critical exon, an exon is split by the targeting cassette imbedded in an artificial intron. More detailed information on the constructs used can be found in the

            <h3> Challenges</h3>
            <p>In order to find defects in the knockout mice that only become apparent when the immune system is challenged, we subject the mice to a broad spectrum of challenges. A Salmonella typhimurium infection as an example of a bacterial infection is carried out by the team of Gordon Dougan at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. For the 3i assays, we chose influenza as a viral infection, Trichuris muris as a parasite infection and DSS colitis as an example of a chemical stressor. Selected strains will furthermore be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</p>
